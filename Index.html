                <p>If you're a manager looking for a practical, proven way to make
                  One-On-Ones
                  actually work, you're in the right place. You don't need another
                  generic article
                  telling you why meetings with your team are important - you need
                  a clear,
                  actionable system that helps you get real results.</p>

                <p>While conventional wisdom encourages regular One-On-Ones with
                  your team
                  (typically 30 minutes to an hour weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly),
                  most resources
                  only offer vague topic suggestions without showing you how to
                  make these meetings
                  truly effective.</p>

                <p>At Manager Tools, we don't just tell you to have One-On-Ones, we
                  show you exactly
                  how to do them. Our method is practical, straightforward, and
                  tested by thousands
                  of managers. No fluff, no wasted time, just a structured
                  approach to build strong
                  relationships and boost team performance.</p>

                  A One-On-One (or 1:1 meeting) is the most powerful
                  conversation-based
                  tool available to managers. It's a weekly, 30-minute structured
                  discussion with your direct report that follows a simple format:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Your direct report goes first</strong> - They share
                    what's
                    on their mind.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>You go second</strong> - You provide guidance,
                    coaching, and
                    support.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>You take notes</strong> - Because what your people
                    say
                    matters.
                  </li>

                <p>
                  No complicated agendas or wasted time - just a regular
                  conversation
                  that strengthens relationships and drives performance.

              <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                  Most managers believe they communicate with their team "all the
                  time." But hallway conversations don't build the foundation
                  needed for effective leadership. Without scheduled 1:1 meetings,
                  the
                  conversations that truly matter simply don't happen. When you
                  meet
                  regularly with your team, you're not just staying informed -
                  you're
                  leading with intention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our research shows these individual meetings deliver four key
                  benefits
                  that directly impact both relationships and results:
                </p>

                  Improved Communication &amp; Early Problem Detection
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Communication gaps cause most workplace problems. Regular 1:1
                  meetings
                  establish a dedicated space where important issues don't fall
                  through
                  the cracks, enabling faster problem-solving. Issues identified
                  in
                  these conversations are typically caught weeks earlier than they
                  would
                  be otherwise, preventing small concerns from becoming major
                  problems.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Trust isn't built through team meetings or annual reviews but
                  through
                  regular individual conversations. When employees feel heard,
                  they're
                  more engaged and motivated. Your weekly manager-direct report
                  meetings
                  signal you care about your people - not just their work -
                  providing a
                  space where trust develops, leading to more honest conversations
                  and
                  stronger commitment.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subsection-title">
                  Coaching, Feedback &amp; Accountability
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Great managers don't wait for annual reviews. Structured
                  One-On-Ones
                  foster natural accountability cycles and a rhythm for coaching
                  that
                  drives steady progress on goals. Your team members will make
                  more
                  progress simply because they know they'll be discussing it with
                  you
                  next week, allowing you to course-correct and help your people
                  grow.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Deep Insight &amp; Better Leadership
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Your job as a manager is to get results through your team, and
                  you
                  can't do that if you don't truly know them. What motivates them?
                  What
                  frustrates them? Where do they want to grow? Regular individual
                  meetings give you the insights you need to lead effectively,
                  helping
                  you make better decisions and unlock your team's full potential.

                    Thousands of managers around the world use this method every
                    week.
                    Manager Tools data from over 175,000+ managers shows that
                    weekly
                    One-On-Ones significantly improve trust, retention, and

                    Unlike most management advice based on anecdotes or HR
                    trends, our
                    One-On-One meeting recommendations are backed by extensive
                    research
                    with over 175,000 managers worldwide. Our guidance is
                    supported by
                    hard data, not opinions.

                    The Power of 1:1 Meetings: What Our Research Shows
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Our studies across hundreds of thousands of managers
                    revealed
                    compelling evidence:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Weekly manager - direct report meetings
                      <strong>improved results and retention by an average of
                        8%</strong>
                      - a significant achievement in management effectiveness
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Biweekly 1:1 meetings showed only <strong>3%</strong>
                      improvement
                      (roughly 40% as effective as weekly meetings)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Monthly individual meetings actually decreased results
                      and
                      retention
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    <strong>These improvements were consistent regardless
                      of:</strong>
                  </p>

                    <li>Management level (from frontline to director level)</li>
                    <li>Geographic location (tested on every inhabited

                    Why Structured Individual Meetings Work: The Science
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Management science has identified that just four behaviors
                    account
                    for 75% of a manager's ability to achieve results and
                    retention:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Getting to know your people (40% of impact)</li>
                    <li>Talking about performance (30% of impact)</li>
                    <li>Asking for more (15% of impact)</li>
                    <li>Pushing work down (15% of impact)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Weekly One-On-Ones are the most effective way to implement
                    these key
                    behaviors, particularly "getting to know your people," which
                    alone
                    represents 40% of your ability to improve results and
                    retention.

                  <p>
                    In one study following over 1,100 managers, we discovered
                    that of 43
                    managers who were promoted during the study period, 42 came
                    from the
                    group conducting regular One-On-Ones. Government
                    organizations
                    implementing structured 1:1 meetings saw improvements
                    ranging from
                    8% to 21%, with some specialized teams improving results by
                    over
                    50%.

                  Structure creates freedom. Without a clear format, One-On-Ones
                  become
                  inconsistent, rushed, or aimless. The Manager Tools One-On-One
                  structure
                  brings focus, balance, and rhythm to every conversation -
                  without turning
                  it into a formal review session.

                <p>
                  A well-run One-On-One includes time for your direct's
                  priorities, your
                  updates, and coaching for the future. That's how relationships
                  deepen,
                  issues surface early, and performance improves week over week.

                      <p> Yes, really. This time truly belongs to your direct.
                        If they want to talk
                        about puppies and rainbows, that's perfectly fine.
                        There's no requirement
                        for them to discuss work-related topics at all. Why?
                        Because people measure
                        the quality of communication by whether the topic
                        interests them personally.
                        Most of the time, they'll naturally talk about work
                        - but don't force it.
                        Giving them full control over this portion builds
                        trust and strengthens your
                        relationship. </p>

                        resolving issues, sharing updates are all
                        appropriate. And if you want

                        talk
                        about something personal, you can. It's your time to

                    be rigid about
                    this
                    structure, especially in the beginning. As you build trust,

                      <li><strong>Choose one opening question</strong> and use
                        it habitually (e.g.,
                        "How's it going?" or "What's on your mind?")</li>
                      <li><strong>Write down the answer every time</strong> to

                <div class="section-content">
                  <p>One-On-Ones are business meetings, but they shouldn't feel
                    stiff. A
                    conversational approach with natural back-and-forth dialogue
                    helps your directs
                    feel comfortable, builds trust gradually, and encourages
                    honest communication.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Tips to keep it natural:</h4>
                  <p><strong>Expect early awkwardness:</strong> Don't worry if
                    your first few
                    One-On-Ones feel a bit formal or stilted. This is completely
                    normal as both you
                    and your directs adjust to the new format. Focus on
                    consistency first -- the
                    conversational flow will develop naturally over time.</p>
                  <p><strong>Ask questions during their time:</strong> Don't treat
                    your direct's
                    portion like a presentation where you can't interject. Ask
                    clarifying questions,
                    probe deeper, and show genuine curiosity. This creates a
                    dynamic exchange rather
                    than a one-sided report.</p>
                  <p><strong>Blend shared topics:</strong> When your direct brings
                    up a topic that's
                    also on your list, address it together rather than waiting
                    for "your time." Say
                    something like, "That's on my list too--let's discuss it
                    now." This creates a
                    more natural flow.</p>
                  <p><strong>Be flexible with time:</strong> If you cover some of
                    your agenda items
                    during their time, mentally extend their portion. The goal
                    is meaningful
                    conversation, not rigid adherence to the clock or
                    checklists. Avoid overly
                    structured formats that can make the meeting feel
                    mechanical.</p>
                  <p><strong>Encourage questions during your time:</strong>
                    Explicitly tell your
                    directs that interruptions and questions are welcome when
                    you're speaking. This
                    creates true two-way communication.</p>
                  <p>Don't rush to fill silences - give space for reflection.
                    Share small
                    observations or appreciation when it's genuine.</p>
                  <p>A relaxed manager is an effective manager. When you show
                    you're listening, your
                    directs will share what really matters.</p>

                    One-On-Ones aren't optional. They're not a "nice to have"-
                    they're your

                    Our purpose in a One-On-One is to create relationships. And
                    we do this not
                    only
                    because we care about our team but because great
                    relationships create
                    great
                    results. Our primary reason to conduct One-On-Ones is that
                    we believe the
                    time
                    spent doing them leads to better overall business results
                    than any other
                    use
                    of
                    that time.

                  <h4 class="subsection-title">Here's Why They're Essential:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>They drive results.</strong> Better
                      relationships = better
                      performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>They create accountability.</strong> Weekly
                      check-ins make
                      follow-through more likely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>They're worth defending.</strong> If you
                      wouldn't cancel a
                      meeting
                      with your CEO, don't cancel one with your team.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4 class="subsection-title">Handling Resistance</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Initial resistance is normal:</strong> Early
                      missed meetings
                      rarely
                      become a pattern. Be patient but firm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Personal content is secondary:</strong> Let your
                      directs lead on
                      how
                      personal they want to be, but remember the primary
                      purpose is
                      professional.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Don't oversell:</strong> If your directs
                      question the need for
                      One-On-Ones, don't waste time repeatedly selling the
                      concept. You've
                      already
                      explained the rationale. Instead, treat them like any
                      other required
                      business
                      meeting - because that's exactly what they are.

                      managers
                      prefer
                      all
                      One-On-Ones on one day; others prefer spreading them
                      throughout the
                      week.
                      Both approaches have merit and neither is better than
                      the other.

                    A good One-On-One rollout builds trust, avoids

                    The Manager Tools' golden rule of management change is,
                    "Never
                    introduce a managerial change without first introducing
                    that
                    change." This is especially true for One-On-Ones, where
                    your
                    goal
                    is
                    to build trust. Trying to build trust while
                    simultaneously
                    appearing
                    secretive about your motives to your direct reports only
                    makes
                    everything harder.
                  </p>
                  <p> Use an existing staff meeting to introduce One-On-Ones.
                    There's
                    no
                    need for a special meeting - that would make it seem
                    more
                    dramatic
                    than necessary. If you don't have a weekly staff
                    meeting,
                    call
                    a
                    short special meeting, but let this be a lesson: you
                    need a

                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a simple framework:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start With WHY</strong> - "I want to build
                      more trusting relationships with each of you. I feel
                      like we communicate a lot, but I think we could
                      communicate more purposefully and better. The only
                      way I know to build trust is by communicating
                      regularly about things that are important to us -
                      and by 'us,' I mostly mean you."</li>
                    <li><strong>Then Explain WHAT</strong> - "To work on our
                      trust,
                      I'm
                      going to meet with each of you individually every
                      week for
                      half
                      an
                      hour. Non-negotiable. We'll call them One-On-Ones.
                      The
                      agenda
                      will
                      be the same every week: you go first, I go second."
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Finish With HOW</strong> - "You'll receive
                      an
                      email
                      from
                      me with scheduling options. These meetings are
                      scheduled
                      for
                      the
                      same time every week. If we need to reschedule,
                      we'll do
                      it
                      immediately rather than cancelling.</li>

                <div class="section-content">
                  <p>Use a simple 4-step process:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scan your schedule</strong> - One-On-Ones
                      are
                      your
                      most important meetings, so they go on the calendar
                      first.
                      Look through your calendar and eliminate times that
                      are
                      already taken by standing meetings, family
                      commitments,
                      and
                      necessary buffer times. What is left are the
                      potential
                      times
                      to offer.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Offer 1.5X times</strong> - Take the number
                      of
                      directs you have, multiply by 1.5, and make that
                      many
                      30-minute slots available from your review process.
                      Don't
                      try
                      to fit exactly the number of directs into exactly
                      that
                      number
                      of slots - it rarely works. Providing extra slots
                      also
                      allows
                      for them to have some freedom in choosing a time
                      slot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Allow your directs to choose</strong> - Send
                      out
                      your
                      options and let them select the time that works best
                      for
                      each
                      of them. This small gesture of control makes a
                      significant
                      difference in their commitment to the process.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>It's okay to ask for 1-2 changes </strong> -
                      If responses surprise
                      you or multiple directs request the same time, you
                      may need to ask for
                      adjustments. Be flexible - the value you'll gain
                      once you start will more
                      than make up for it. </li>

                    We recommend you wait three weeks before you start your

                    <li>Gives you time to answer individual questions (not

                    <p>During the first few weeks of One-On-Ones, allow
                      your
                      direct to talk as
                      long as needed, even if they use the entire 30
                      minutes. Resist the urge to
                      interrupt them, as this builds trust and shows
                      that
                      you genuinely value
                      their perspective. Cutting them off too soon
                      signals
                      that you care more
                      about the format than the relationship.</p>
                    <p>After establishing a consistent pattern of
                      meetings
                      (typically 3-4 weeks),
                      you can gently guide the conversation toward
                      more
                      balance with this
                      approach: "I really value hearing from you. To
                      make
                      sure we both benefit
                      from these meetings, could we aim for about
                      15-20
                      minutes for your topics
                      and 10 minutes for mine going forward?"</p>
                    <p>Most directs will naturally adjust to a more
                      balanced
                      conversation rhythm
                      over time. Remember that the ultimate goal is
                      effective communication, not
                      perfect time allocation. If needed, you can
                      always
                      schedule additional time
                      outside your regular One-On-Ones to address
                      overflow
                      topics.</p>

                    <p>
                      It's more common for managers to worry that
                      their
                      directs
                      won't
                      talk than it is for directs to actually stay
                      silent.
                      But
                      if
                      that
                      does happen:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ask twice. "Is there anything else on your
                        mind?"
                        <em>(Pause. Wait.)</em>
                      </li>
                      <li>If they still won't engage, move on - but
                        keep
                        holding
                        the
                        30-minute meeting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After a few weeks of consistent One-On-Ones, say
                      gently:
                      These
                      meetings aren't optional. Even if you don't have
                      much to
                      share
                      now, I still want to connect regularly.

                      Be patient. Most people open up after 4 - 6

                      weekly

                    </h4>
                    <p>One of the most frequent questions managers ask
                      is
                      how to
                      get
                      directs to address the manager's agenda during
                      One-On-Ones.
                      The
                      simple answer: don't try. Their portion of the
                      O3 is
                      meant
                      for
                      their agenda, not yours.
                    </p>
                    <p>Remember that the primary purpose of One-On-Ones
                      is
                      to
                      build
                      trust through high-quality communication. Trust
                      makes
                      everything
                      easier - work happens faster, communications are
                      shorter,
                      and
                      guidance can be inferred from previous
                      conversations.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Trust is built by talking about things
                        important
                        to
                        your
                        direct</li>
                      <li>Most manager-direct conversations already
                        center
                        on
                        the
                        manager's agenda</li>

                    <p>There are two key behaviors to ensure your agenda

                      structure:

                        structure, and
                        expectations so they understand how it

                      a
                      weekly 1:1. Here's how to reframe it:</p>

                        you
                        time with me to surface problems, ask for
                        help, or
                        think
                        ahead."</li>
                      <li><strong>Reinforce that it's consistent for

                        manage, not who I manage."</li>
                      <li><strong>Contrast it with real
                          micromanagement:
                        </strong>
                        "Micromanagement is when I check your work

                    <p>Emphasize that your goal is their success, not

                    Status
                    Updates</h4>
                  <p>When the conversation becomes a project checklist,
                    you
                    lose
                    the
                    opportunity to build trust and uncover issues. Let
                    your
                    direct
                    lead - then use your time to guide, coach, and
                    clarify.</p>
                  <p>It's tempting to use One-On-Ones to check on project
                    progress -
                    but that's not what they're for. When the entire
                    focus of
                    the
                    meeting shifts to tasks and deadlines, you lose the
                    opportunity
                    to build trust, surface concerns, and coach
                    effectively.
                  </p>
                  <p> Because of the natural power imbalance between a
                    manager
                    and a
                    direct report, your people won't speak up unless
                    they know
                    the
                    time is for them. When One-On-Ones become just about
                    status,
                    team members disengage and the honest conversations
                    that
                    could
                    prevent problems never happen.
                  </p>
                  <p>One-On-Ones work best when the direct's agenda comes
                    first.
                    That's how you build the relationships that make
                    everything
                    else - tasks, deadlines, and results - go more
                    smoothly. If
                    your
                    One-On-Ones keep running long on project
                    discussions,
                    schedule a
                    separate meeting to tackle those issues and keep
                    your
                    weekly
                    One-On-Ones focused on relationship building.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="subsection-title">Cancelling or Skipping</h4>
                  <p>Cancelling One-On-Ones sends the message that your
                    team
                    isn't a
                    priority. If you must move one, reschedule it
                    immediately.
                    Never
                    just let it slide.</p>
                  <p>If we say One-On-Ones are our most important meeting
                    (and
                    they
                    are), then travel - <em>or anything else</em> -
                    shouldn't
                    be
                    a
                    reason to skip them. Otherwise, we've created a
                    system
                    where
                    anything can justify cancelling. That's how
                    consistency
                    breaks
                    down and relationships weaken.</p>
                  <p>Even when you're on the road, One-On-Ones can and
                    should
                    happen. A phone call, a quick video chat, they still
                    count.
                    You
                    don't have to be in the office to show up for your
                    team.
                    And
                    when you keep that time sacred, your team notices
                    and
                    trusts
                    you
                    more because of it. </p>
                  <h4 class="subsection-title">Starting and Stopping</h4>
                  <p>Starting One-On-Ones and then letting them fade is
                    worse
                    than
                    never doing them at all. It erodes trust and teaches
                    your
                    team
                    that consistency isn't expected.</p>
                  <p>Starting One-On-Ones and then letting them fade
                    damages
                    trust, signals lack of importance, and teaches your
                    team
                    that
                    new initiatives aren't worth investing in - because
                    you
                    won't

                  <p>Managers often stop after a few weeks when the
                    initial
                    effort
                    feels hard and results aren't immediate. But
                    One-On-Ones
                    are
                    about long-term relationship building, not
                    short-term
                    wins.
                    Starting and quitting creates "flavor of the month"
                    resistance, where your team disengages from future
                    changes
                    before they begin.</p>
                  <p>Consistency builds trust. Quitting breaks it.</p>

                        One-On-Ones
                        with their directs! You can do skip level

                        occasionally, following a very specific
                        format.
                        Skip-level
                        meetings are not One-On-Ones. While it's
                        valuable to
                        meet
                        occasionally with your directs' directs,
                        these
                        should
                        not be
                        called One-On-Ones or follow the One-On-One
                        format.

                        their
                        directs. Skip-level meetings have different
                        purposes
                        and
                        dynamics that require a different approach.
