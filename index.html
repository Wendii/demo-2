              <p>If you're a manager looking for a practical, proven way to make
                One-On-Ones actually work, you're in the right place. You don't need
                another generic article telling you why meetings with your team are
                important-you need a clear, actionable system that helps you get real
                results.</p>
              <p>"Everyone" tells you to take time to have One-On-Ones with your team. They
                say to use 30 minutes to an hour (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) and offer
                a vague list of topics. But they never show you how to make these meetings
                effective.</p>
              <p> At Manager Tools, we don't just tell you to have One-On-Ones, we show you
                exactly how to do them. Our method is practical, straightforward, and
                tested by thousands of managers. No fluff, no wasted time, just a
                structured approach to build strong relationships and boost team
                performance.</p>
              <p>Not sure if One-On-Ones are worth it?

                    <p>A One-On-One (or 1:1 meeting) is the most powerful conversation-based tool available to managers. It's a weekly, 30-minute structured discussion with your direct report that follows a simple format:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Your direct report goes first</strong> - They share what's on their mind.</li>
                      <li><strong>You go second</strong> - You provide guidance, coaching, and support.</li>
                      <li><strong>You take notes</strong> - Because what your people say matters.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>No complicated agendas or wasted time--just a regular conversation that strengthens relationships and drives performance.</p>

                Structure creates freedom. Without a clear format, One-On-Ones become
                inconsistent, rushed, or aimless. The Manager Tools One-On-One structure
                brings focus, balance, and rhythm to every conversation--without turning
                it into a formal review session.
              </p>
              <p>
                A well-run One-On-One includes time for your direct's priorities, your
                updates, and coaching for the future. That's how relationships deepen,
                issues surface early, and performance improves week over week.

          <div class="section-content">
            <p>The Manager Tools agenda follows a simple structure:</p>

            <div class="callout">
              <div class="callout-icon" aria-label="Info"</div>
              <div class="callout-content">
                <h4 class="callout-title">First 10 minutes -- Your direct's time</h4>
                <p>
                  Yes, really. If your direct wants to talk about puppies and rainbows, they can. There's no requirement for them to talk about work at all. Why? Because people measure the quality of communication by whether the topic is interesting to them. Most of the time, they'll talk about work -- but don't force it. Giving them full control over this time builds trust and strengthens your relationship.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">

              <div class="callout-content">
                <h4 class="callout-title">Next 10 minutes -- Your time</h4>
                <p>
                  Now it's your turn. This will probably be work-related. Checking on projects, resolving issues, sharing updates are all appropriate. And if you want to talk about something personal, you can. It's your time to focus on what matters most to you in communicating with this direct.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">
              <div class="callout-icon" aria-label="Info"</div>
              <div class="callout-content">
                <h4 class="callout-title">Last 10 minutes -- Coaching, career growth, and long-term goals</h4>
                <p>
                  When there's time, use the final 10 minutes for the future. This is where coaching and career planning happen -- the things most managers say they never have time for.
                </p>

            <p>
              In practice, this might look more like 15 - 15, and only getting to future development occasionally. That's normal. You don't need to be rigid about this structure, especially in the beginning. As you build trust, the conversations will naturally become more balanced and productive.

            <p>
              The power of One-On-Ones isn't in any single meeting but in their consistency over time. One simple practice can dramatically improve your One-On-One effectiveness: ask the same first question every time.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subsection-title m-t-24">Why This Works:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Creates predictable structure that builds trust</li>
              <li>Helps you notice patterns and changes in responses</li>
              <li>Eliminates wasted mental energy figuring out how to start</li>
              <li>Makes it easier to track your direct's state of mind over time</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="subsection-title m-t-24">Keys to Success:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Choose one opening question</strong> and use it habitually (e.g., "How's it going?" or "What's on your mind?")</li>
              <li><strong>Write down the answer every time</strong> to help identify trends and changes</li>
              <li><strong>Focus on listening</strong> rather than trying to be creative with your opener</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="m-t-24">
              This simple approach shifts your attention from worrying about the perfect question to what really matters: understanding your team member's response and how it changes over time.

          <div class="section-content">
            <p>One-On-Ones are business meetings, but they shouldn't feel stiff. A conversational approach with natural back-and-forth dialogue helps your directs feel comfortable, builds trust gradually, and encourages honest communication.</p>

            <h4 class="subsection-title m-t-24">Tips to Keep It Natural:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Expect early awkwardness:</strong> First few One-On-Ones may feel formal. Focus on consistency--the conversational flow will follow.</li>
              <li><strong>Ask questions during their time:</strong> Clarify, probe deeper, and show curiosity.</li>
              <li><strong>Blend shared topics:</strong> If something is on both of your lists, address it together.</li>
              <li><strong>Be flexible with time:</strong> Adjust based on the flow of conversation rather than sticking rigidly to time slots.</li>
              <li><strong>Encourage questions during your time:</strong> Let your directs know they can interrupt.</li>
              <li><strong>Avoid checklists or rigid agendas.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Don't rush to fill silences</strong> -- allow reflection.</li>
              <li><strong>Share small observations or appreciation</strong> when it's genuine.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="m-t-24">A relaxed manager is an effective manager. When you show you're listening, your directs will share what really matters.</p>

          <div class="section-content">
            <p>One-On-Ones aren't optional. They're not a "nice to have"--they're your most important meeting every week.</p>
            <p>Our purpose in a One-On-One is to create relationships. And we do this not only because we care about our team but because great relationships create great results. The time spent doing them leads to better overall business outcomes than any other use of that time.</p>

            <h4 class="subsection-title m-t-24">Here's Why They're Essential:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>They drive results:</strong> Better relationships = better performance.</li>
              <li><strong>They create accountability:</strong> Weekly check-ins make follow-through more likely.</li>
              <li><strong>They're worth defending:</strong> If you wouldn't cancel a meeting with your CEO, don't cancel one with your team.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="subsection-title m-t-24">Handling Resistance</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Initial resistance is normal:</strong> Early missed meetings rarely become a pattern. Be patient but firm.</li>
              <li><strong>Personal content is secondary:</strong> Let your directs lead on how personal they want to be--but remember the primary purpose is professional.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't oversell:</strong> If your directs question the need, explain once and then treat it like any other required meeting.</li>

              <li><strong>Schedule on the hour or half-hour:</strong> This respects the reality that most other meetings start at these times.</li>
              <li><strong>Choose your approach to grouping:</strong> Some managers prefer all One-On-Ones on one day; others prefer spreading them throughout the week.</li>
              <li><strong>Consider back-to-back scheduling:</strong> Choose what works for your energy and attention span.</li>
              <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Whatever pattern you choose, maintain it to build trust and habit.</li>

                Don't just drop weekly One-On-Ones into your team's calendar and hope
                for the best. How you introduce these 30-minute manager meetings affects
                how your team responds--and whether they engage meaningfully or resist
                silently.

                A good One-On-One rollout builds trust, avoids surprises, and sets you
                up for long-term consistency with your regular meeting schedule. Here
                are the steps to take:

          <div class="section-content visible">
            <p>The Manager Tools' golden rule of management change is, "Never introduce a managerial change without first introducing that change." This is especially true for One-On-Ones, where your goal is to build trust.</p>
            <p>Use an existing staff meeting to introduce One-On-Ones--no need to make it dramatic. If you don't have a weekly staff meeting, hold a short one. (Hint: you should have one.)</p>
            <p>Here's a simple framework:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Start With WHY:</strong> "I want to build more trusting relationships..."</li>
              <li><strong>Then Explain WHAT:</strong> "To work on our trust, I'm going to meet with each of you..."</li>
              <li><strong>Finish With HOW:</strong> "You'll receive an email with scheduling options..."</li>

                  Even when you're implementing One-On-Ones correctly, some challenges
                  will arise. That doesn't mean your weekly manager meetings aren't
                  working--it just means you're dealing with normal human dynamics.

              <li>Ask twice. "Is there anything else on your mind?" <em>(Pause. Wait.)</em></li>
              <li>If they still won't engage, move on--but keep holding the meeting.</li>
            </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li><strong>Reinforce that it's consistent for everyone:</strong> "Everyone on the team gets this time. It's how I manage, not who I manage."</li>
                  <li><strong>Contrast it with real micromanagement:</strong> "Micromanagement is when I check your work constantly. This is the opposite--it's time to give you support, not control."</li>

                <h4>What If They Still Resist?</h4>
                <p>In rare cases (less than 0.1%), a direct will continue to resist participating in weekly One-On-Ones even after several months. This requires a more direct approach. After 3 months of consistent resistance, have a serious conversation about the impact.</p>
                <p>When a team member persistently resists One-On-Ones:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Have a private conversation about expectations</li>
                  <li><strong>Predict--not threaten--the consequences:</strong> "If this continues, I'll need to note it in performance discussions. These 30-minute meetings are a core part of how I lead."</li>
                  <li><strong>Frame it as support, not punishment:</strong> "This isn't about conflict--it's about making sure you have what you need, and that I can do my job well."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Emphasize that your goal is their success, not conflict. Remember that this level of intervention is rarely needed. Most resistance to implementing One-On-Ones resolves naturally with consistency and patience.</p>

                  <li><strong>Put the time in perspective:</strong> "It's just 1% of your work week--some people spend more than 1% of their week getting coffee!"</li>

              <h4>Scheduling Challenges with Remote or Shift Teams</h4>
              <p>One-On-Ones can work across any environment--with a little creativity in your meeting schedule.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>For shift workers:</strong> Schedule One-On-Ones at shift transitions when possible or find overlap times</li>
                <li><strong>For remote teams:</strong> Use video whenever possible for your weekly One-On-Ones and be even more diligent about keeping to schedule</li>
                <li><strong>For traveling employees:</strong> Establish a consistent phone/video protocol and protect that 30-minute meeting time</li>
                <li><strong>Consider slightly longer</strong> but less frequent One-On-Ones if weekly truly isn't possible</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Maintain the meetings:</strong> Whatever pattern you establish for your One-On-Ones, stick to it. Consistency matters more than location when building trust through regular manager-direct meetings.</p>

                <h4>Turning One-On-Ones into Status Updates</h4>
                <p>When the conversation becomes a project checklist, you lose the opportunity to build trust and uncover issues. Let your direct lead--then use your time to guide, coach, and clarify.</p>
                <p>It's tempting to use One-On-Ones to check on project progress--but that's not what they're for. When the entire focus of the meeting shifts to tasks and deadlines, you lose the opportunity to build trust, surface concerns, and coach effectively.</p>
                <p>Because of the natural power imbalance between a manager and a direct report, your people won't speak up unless they know the time is for them. When One-On-Ones become just about status, team members disengage and the honest conversations that could prevent problems never happen.</p>
                <p>One-On-Ones work best when the direct's agenda comes first. That's how you build the relationships that make everything else--tasks, deadlines, and results--go more smoothly. If your One-On-Ones keep running long on project discussions, schedule a separate meeting to tackle those issues and keep your weekly One-On-Ones focused on relationship building.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="subsection">
                <h4>Cancelling or Skipping</h4>
                <p>Cancelling One-On-Ones sends the message that your team isn't a priority. If you must move one, reschedule it immediately. Never just let it slide.</p>
                <p>If we say One-On-Ones are our most important meeting (and they are), then travel--or anything else--shouldn't be a reason to skip them. Otherwise, we've created a system where anything can justify cancelling. That's how consistency breaks down and relationships weaken.</p>
                <p>Even when you're on the road, One-On-Ones can and should happen. A phone call, a quick video chat, they still count. You don't have to be in the office to show up for your team. And when you keep that time sacred, your team notices and trusts you more because of it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="subsection">
                <h4>Starting and Stopping</h4>
                <p>Starting One-On-Ones and then letting them fade is worse than never doing them at all. It erodes trust and teaches your team that consistency isn't expected.</p>
                <p>Starting One-On-Ones and then letting them fade damages trust, signals lack of importance, and teaches your team that new initiatives aren't worth investing in--because you won't stick with them.</p>
                <p>Managers often stop after a few weeks when the initial effort feels hard and results aren't immediate. But One-On-Ones are about long-term relationship building, not short-term wins. Starting and quitting creates "flavor of the month" resistance, where your team disengages from future changes before they begin.</p>
                <p>Consistency builds trust. Quitting breaks it.</p>

                Even experienced managers have questions about implementing and
                maintaining effective One-On-Ones. Here are answers to the most common
                questions we receive, with links to podcasts where you can find more
                detailed guidance.

              <h4>Do One-On-Ones really need to be weekly?</h4>
              <p><strong>Yes, they do.</strong> Weekly 30-minute One-On-Ones are optimal for relationship building and effective management. When meetings are less frequent, the relationship-building effect diminishes dramatically, and issues that could have been caught early fester. Weekly manager-direct meetings create a rhythm and consistency that builds trust.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
              <h4>Can One-On-Ones be shorter than 30 minutes?</h4>
              <p><strong>We don't recommend it.</strong> While it might seem more efficient to conduct 15-minute One-On-Ones, especially with a large team, the shortened timeframe undermines the relationship-building purpose. You need at least 30 minutes to allow for meaningful conversation and the natural ebb and flow of communication.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
              <h4>Should I have longer One-On-Ones with senior directs?</h4>
              <p><strong>Not necessarily.</strong> The purpose of a weekly One-On-One is the same regardless of the seniority of your direct: to build a relationship through regular communication. A senior direct may have more complex topics to discuss, but the 30-minute format still works well. If you consistently need more time, consider scheduling a separate meeting for specific projects or strategic discussions.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
              <h4>What's the best first question to ask in a One-On-One?</h4>
              <p><strong>"How's it going?"</strong> This simple, open-ended question works best for starting One-On-Ones. It's casual enough to put people at ease but open enough to allow for a wide range of responses. Using the same question every week creates a reliable ritual and helps you spot patterns in responses over time. That said, you can choose a question that works for you.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
              <h4>Should I prepare an agenda for each One-On-One?</h4>
              <p>The agenda for a 30-minute One-On-One is always the same -- 10 minutes for your direct, 10 minutes for you, and 10 minutes for the future. However, each week, the exact balance will change depending on what your direct and you have to share. Your direct's topics should always come first, and your list of items needs to be adaptable based on what they share.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
              <h4>How do I make One-On-Ones more conversational and less formal?</h4>
              <p><strong>Focus on building the relationship, not checking boxes.</strong> While the structure (their time, your time) provides a helpful framework, the conversation should flow naturally. Use follow-up questions, show genuine interest, and avoid rushing to the next topic. The more comfortable you are with silence and letting conversations develop, the more natural your weekly One-On-Ones will feel.</p>
              <p>For practical techniques, listen to <a href="/2015/04/conversational-one-on-ones" target="_blank">Conversational One-On-Ones</a> and <a href="/2019/07/soft-one-ones-part-1" target="_blank">Soft One-On-Ones</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
              <h4>Should I give feedback during One-On-Ones?</h4>
              <p><strong>Yes </strong> and... One-On-Ones are an appropriate and useful time for you to give Manager Tools Feedback. However, that doesn't mean you should always wait to give Feedback then. Don't turn your weekly One-On-One into a "Feedback session." Doing so defeats the purpose of both One-On-Ones and Feedback!</p>
              <p>If you're just starting One-On-Ones, we don't recommend you start Manager Tools Feedback for 12 weeks. Learn more about why and how <a href="/2024/06/rolling-out-trinity-part-1-hall-fame-guidance" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

              <h4>What's the best way to do remote/virtual One-On-Ones?</h4>
              <p><strong>Video is ideal for remote One-On-Ones.</strong> Visual cues are crucial for building relationships and understanding the full context of communication. Other best practices:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Eliminate distractions even more rigorously than for in-person meetings</li>
                <li>Test your technology before the meeting starts</li>
                <li>Be even more disciplined about scheduling and punctuality</li>

              <h4>Should I do "skip-level" One-On-Ones?</h4>
              <p><strong>No.</strong> Your directs should do One-On-Ones with their directs! You can do skip level meetings occasionally, following a very specific format. Skip-level meetings are not One-On-Ones. While it's valuable to meet occasionally with your directs' directs, these should not be called One-On-Ones or follow the One-On-One format. True One-On-Ones only happen between direct managers and their directs. Skip-level meetings have different purposes and dynamics that require a different approach.</p>

              <h4>What if my boss doesn't want me to do One-On-Ones?</h4>
              <p>Bosses who don't do One-On-Ones themselves sometimes have reasonable concerns, which can usually be overcome once you understand them. Boss pushback usually comes from one of a few sources: concerns about time management, misunderstanding the purpose of One-On-Ones, or worry about consistency. Your approach:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ask what specific concerns they have</li>
                <li>Explain the business benefits in terms they care about</li>
                <li>Suggest a trial period with specific metrics</li>

              <h4>How do I handle creative professionals who resist One-On-Ones?</h4>
              <p><strong>Focus on how One-On-Ones support their creative work.</strong> Creative professionals sometimes resist structure, viewing it as constraining rather than enabling. To address this resistance to weekly One-On-Ones:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Explain that One-On-Ones help remove obstacles to their creative work</li>
                <li>Emphasize that the meetings protect time for bigger-picture thinking by reducing interruptions</li>
                <li>Make clear that One-On-Ones are about supporting their success</li>

              <h4>What if my directs say there's no time for One-On-Ones?</h4>
              <p><strong>Be clear that One-On-Ones are non-negotiable.</strong> The "no time" objection is common but rarely valid. Weekly One-On-Ones take just 1% of a direct's workweek. When directs claim they don't have time for these 30-minute meetings:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Acknowledge the concern but don't accept it as a valid reason to skip meetings</li>
                <li>Put the time in perspective (30 minutes out of 40+ hours)</li>
                <li>Explain that One-On-Ones actually save time by preventing larger issues</li>
                <li>If necessary, help them identify lower-priority activities they can scale back</li>
